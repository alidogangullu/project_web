## Web App

This repository contains the web application for our restaurant management project. The web app allows users to view the restaurant menu without requiring them to download the mobile app.

## Project Overview

This project consists of multiple components, including:

- [Mobile App](https://github.com/alidogangullu/project_mobile): The customer interface of the mobile app, allowing customers to follow restaurants, search for restaurants, and scan QR codes on restaurant tables. The manager interface of the mobile app, allowing restaurant managers to add restaurants, design menus, and share posts.
- [Desktop App](https://github.com/alidogangullu/project_desktop): The desktop application for waiters to view and manage orders in the restaurant.
- [Web App](https://github.com/alidogangullu/project_web): A web application that displays the restaurant menu without requiring users to download the mobile app.
